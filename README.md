# Project Digibod Augment Controller
**The processor for an individual Digibod augment**

## About
The code in this repository is for a Digibod Augment Controller. Each Augment
Controller is responsible for handling sensor inputs and converting them into a
usable form for the Digibod Augment Hub.

### Hardware
Each Digibod agument controller uses an Arduino Uno.

### Software
This project is made using the Arduino IDE.

This project uses a port of the C++ standard library for Arduino found
[here](https://github.com/VioletGiraffe/StandardCplusplus). Download the library
in zip form, and add it as a library in the Arduino IDE (Sketch > Include Library >
Include .ZIP Library).
